          <h1>Fun-Driven Development</h1>

          <h2>The Story</h2>

          <p>A friend of mine with a health problem went to a doctor.</p>

          <p>
            The doctor concluded that a surgery is needed to solve the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            The doctor described a couple of different methods of how to perform
            the required surgery.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the methods was well known and proven to work in most cases,
            but the doctor hesitated to go with it. He then complained to my
            friend that he was using this method for the last 15 years, he’s so
            bored of using it and wants to try something new, fresh and cool.
          </p>

          <p>
            The doctor told my friend about the conference that he visited last
            month where everyone was talking about this new elegant way to do
            the same surgery that my friend needed. The method was invented only
            a couple of years ago, but the community of surgeons was buzzing
            with the excitement, and so was my friend's doctor, who decided to
            give the new method a go.
          </p>

          <p>Except that my friend decided to go to a different doctor.</p>

          <p>How is this situation even possible in real life?</p>

          <p>It’s not. Thankfully, this is not a real-life story.</p>

          <p>
            But replace a friend of mine with a business that you know and the
            doctor with a software developer - and you’ve got a real-life story.
          </p>

          <h2>The Motivation</h2>

          <p>
            I’ve noticed that many software development choices are driven by
            the amount of fun that they bring to software developers. I call
            this approach Fun-Driven Development or FDD.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fundamentally, humans want fun and don’t want responsibility. We’re
            trying to have as much fun as possible while avoiding responsibility
            as much as possible in most things that we do in life, including
            software development.
          </p>

          <p>
            And the younger we are - the more fun and the less responsibility we
            want. The older we get, the more responsibility we’re willing to put
            up with and the less fun we’re willing to pursue.
          </p>

          <p>
            Software developers are
            <a
              href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-age"
              >primarily young</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-other-types-of-education"
              >self taught</a
            >. Their most common motivation for getting into software
            development in the first place is
            <a
              href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-coding-as-a-hobby"
              >fun</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            The common story of a software developer is: “I’ve started playing
            computer games and then decided that I want to create my own game
            and discovered that coding is fun.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Fun is the prime motivation for getting into software development.
          </p>

          <p>
            This motivation is then fuelled by the modern media narrative that
            "coding is fun” and that most young people should consider becoming
            software developers. This is how businesses are trying to solve the
            problem of the shortage of software developers. It’s not a secret
            that today the supply can’t meet the demand.
          </p>

          <p>
            There’s a moment in the life of most hobbyist software developers
            when their phone rings and they’re being recruited to become
            professional software developers.
          </p>

          <p>Now they're paid to have fun. This is the best!</p>

          <p>Except there’s one major problem: a mismatch of motivations.</p>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>

          <p>
            Software developers are motivated by fun and businesses are not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Businesses that hire software developers don’t want fun. They want
            to achieve their business results with the help of software
            development. No fun required.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet businesses don’t have much choice but to offer fun in order to
            attract software developers: "join our company and work in the
            offices that are fun to work in", "join our company and work on the
            problems that are fun to solve", "join our company and work with
            technologies that are fun to use".
          </p>

          <p>
            And now we have a situation where software developers have the
            leverage. They're in control of what technologies businesses use,
            and they make those choices based on what they want to work on, or
            how much fun they want to have.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s easy to justify a tech decision when the chosen tech is "hot"
            and everyone’s talking about it. If everyone’s talking about it - it
            must be good, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            If the business decides to go with something less popular and not
            much fun, software developers have the option to leave this business
            and join the one that uses the desired tech.
          </p>

          <p>
            So companies end up choosing tech not because it’s the best tool for
            the job, but because it’s the best tool for attracting software
            developers.
          </p>

          <p>
            One other interesting aspect of human psychology - we get bored
            easily. We want new things. New things are fun.
          </p>

          <p>
            And so sometimes we invent new tech and then businesses have to
            adjust and reinvest their resources into adopting this new tech. The
            evidence that this new tech is actually better than the current one
            that business uses is not required.
          </p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>

          <p>
            The core problem is the damaging expectation that professional
            software development is supposed to be fun.
          </p>

          <p>No, it’s not.</p>

          <p>
            It’s a job that requires: 1) serious continuous education (SCE) and
            2) serious continuous responsibility (SCR).
          </p>

          <p>The fun aspect of it is a nice bonus, but not more than that.</p>

          <p>
            Serious continuous education means learning from people who’ve been
            doing it for a long time and have a lot of experience. As a
            professional software developer it’s your responsibility to
            continuously educate yourself: read books, watch courses, practice
            on your own personal projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Serious continuous responsibility means you guarantee the quality of
            your work. This requires the discipline of thinking carefully about
            the problem before attempting to solve it, or iterating on the
            solution before commiting to it. But most importantly - choosing the
            best tools for the given problem - even at the cost of not having
            fun using them.
          </p>

          <p>
            It also means taking responsibility for bugs discovered later in
            your code.
          </p>

          <p>
            What businesses really want is more educated and disciplined
            software developers who are not motivated by fun. But if you take
            fun away, you should compensate it with some other strong incentive
            - higher pay or additional benefits.
          </p>

          <p>
            We should establish "the Oscars for software developers" awards
            where every year we celebrate the best achievements in software
            development across different industries. Nominated by businesses and
            judged by experts in the industry.
          </p>
